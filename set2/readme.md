TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week learn how to write code in python. But for the first to see it, it is very confused to doing it. Because sometimes i do not know what should i do and what's the mistake. Sometimes i knwo the logic , but i do not know how to write code. So, in this week i need to do more exercise about it.
